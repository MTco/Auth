User Authentication PHP Class
=============================

This is a simple user authentication class for PHP, which uses
a MySQL Database which is accessed via MySQLi.

The system also includes a Custom user session system, meaning
sessions can last a predefined time, for example, 1 minute to over 10 years
if that was ever needed.

The Current functions are as follows :

- login($username, $password) : Verifies user credentials
- register($username, $password, $verifypassword, $email) : Adds a new user account to the database
- newsession($username) : Creates a new session for the user
- deletesession($hash) : Deletes an existing session from the database, and removes the user's cookie
- sessioninfo($hash) : Retrieves info about the session from database (UID, Username, Expire Date, IP)
- checksession($hash) : Checks if session is valid
- hashpassword($password) : Hashes the password with the following : hash("SHA512", base64_encode(hash("SHA512", $password)))

Hopefully the extended encryption will result in a pratically uncrackable password. The session
system relies on the user's IP, if it changes, the user will have to reauthenticate.

This is still in development, has not been rigourusly tested. The database layout is included in auth.sql
Just Import via PhpMyAdmin into a database preferably named "auth"
